<em>Re-animating historical figures, or phoning a friend.</em>

This project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate a conversation with Patrick Geddes, the Scottish biologist, sociologist, geographer, and town planner. Responses are a combination of knowledge present in the model and documents related to Geddes' work and associated texts.

Coded with the assistance of AI, it connects to the Perplexity API. Full details available at the <a href="https://github.com/robannable/geddes">Github repository</a>.
