<em>Re-animating historical figures, or phoning a friend.</em>

This project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate a conversation with a renowned historical figure. Responses are a combination of information present in the model's dataset plus chosen documents related to their work and associated texts, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to fine tune the knowledge base.
