Re-animating historical figures, or phoning a friend.

This app uses Perplexity AI to simulate a conversation with Patrick Geddes, the Scottish biologist, sociologist, geographer, and town planner. Ask him about his work, ideas, or even modern issues - he'll approach them with his unique interdisciplinary perspective!
