Historically, civic pageants have played a crucial role in expressing cultural identity and fostering community cohesion. 

Patrick Geddes' triad of Folk, Work, and Place provides a useful framework for understanding the evolution and significance of these events. Pageants, festivals and carnivals arise from a strong sense of local identity (Folk), reflect or celebrate local industries and skills (Work) and are deeply rooted in and shaped by their physical environment (Place).

- **Folk**: Many of these events celebrate specific cultural identities. They serve as expressions of community cohesion and cultural preservation.
- **Work**: Some events directly relate to local industries. These celebrations often emerge from or reflect the economic realities of their communities.
- **Place**: Each event is deeply rooted in its geographical context. The place shapes the nature of the celebration and, in turn, the celebration shapes the identity of the place.

These events demonstrate several key trends in reimagining civic engagement:

- **Blending Tradition with Contemporary Issues**: Many events maintain traditional elements while addressing modern concerns.
- **Environmental Focus**: There's a growing trend to incorporate climate change awareness and action into community celebrations.
- **Participatory Design**: These events often involve community members in their creation and execution, fostering a sense of ownership and engagement.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Many combine elements of art, science, and community organizing to create multifaceted experiences.

Large events like the 1951 Festival of Britain or World Expo/Fair (which began in 1851) create new event landscapes at the city block or neighbourhood scale. Your investigations into culture might result in a very specific activity or location, or perhaps the future of the neighbourhood can be imagined as the infrastructure for large festival or expo size celebrations?

*Here are some examples of events of varying scales, with a consideration of how they relate to the Geddes triptych:*

**Brighton Burning of the Clocks**: This winter solstice festival, held annually since 1994, serves as a response to Christmas commercialisation. Participants create lanterns and costumes with clockfaces, symbolizing the passing of time.[^1]
*Connection to Geddes: Folk (community participation), Place (Brighton beach)*

**Notting Hill Carnival**: Held annually since 1966, this carnival celebrates the diverse cultures of London's Caribbean communities. Featuring colourful costumes, steel bands, and Caribbean cuisine, it has grown to become Europe's largest street festival. [^2]
*Connection to Geddes: Folk (Caribbean community), Place (Notting Hill)*

**Straw Bear Festival, Whittlesea**: Revived in 1980, this ancient Fenland custom involves parading a person dressed head to toe in straw through the streets of Whittlesea. The festival, held in January, features traditional music, morris dancing, and mummers' plays. It celebrates the agricultural heritage of the region and marks the end of the plough Monday traditions.[^3]
*Connection to Geddes: Folk (agricultural tradition), Place (Fenland)*

**Belfast TradFest**: Launched in 2019, this festival celebrates Irish traditional music, song, and dance in the heart of Belfast. It aims to showcase Belfast's rich musical heritage and its role in preserving and promoting Irish traditional arts.[^4]
*Connection to Geddes: Folk (Irish traditional music), Place (Belfast)*

**International Day of Birmingham**: Inaugurated in 2024, this event celebrates the diverse cultures and communities that make up Birmingham. It serves as a platform for showcasing "Brummie" identity and fostering community cohesion.[^5]
*Connection to Geddes: Folk (Brummie identity), Place (Birmingham)*

**Easter Bonnet Parade, Luton**: Established in 1953, this annual event celebrates Luton's heritage as a centre of hat-making. Participants create and wear elaborate Easter bonnets, parading through the town centre. The parade combines traditional hat-making skills with creative flair, showcasing the town's industrial past and its enduring community spirit.[^6]
*Connection to Geddes: Work (hat industry), Folk (local tradition)*

**Gresham's Wooden Horse Project**: This one-off community art project in Middlesbrough, inspired by the ancient Greek story of the Trojan Horse, brought together diverse communities in the Gresham area. Led by artist Isabel Lima, participants crafted a wooden horse sculpture, which was paraded through the town and became a focal point for community activities.[^7]
*Connection to Geddes: Folk (community participation), Place (Gresham, Middlesbrough)*

**Ffynnon Las Park Community Project**: A small-scale community initiative in Ammanford, where residents worked together to improve a local park. The project involved repainting equipment, replacing fences, and installing new benches, fostering a sense of community ownership and pride.[^8]

This talk explores the concept of utopia and conceives of an alternative, embedded local version centred around 'islands of coherence'... Where might they be in our neighbourhood and can the pageant or fair celebrate it?
