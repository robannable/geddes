The Negroni is a classic Italian cocktail that has been around for over a century. Here is a brief history and some popular variations:

## History of the Negroni

The most widely accepted origin story is that the Negroni was invented in Florence, Italy in 1919. According to the tale, Count Camillo Negroni asked his bartender at Caffè Casoni to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano (Campari, sweet vermouth, and soda water), by replacing the soda with gin. [3]

The bartender, Fosco Scarselli, made the substitution and the Negroni was born. It quickly became popular, with drinkers asking for "one of Count Negroni's cocktails." By the 1950s, the equal parts recipe of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth was codified as the Negroni. [13]

However, there are other claimed origins, such as it being invented by General Pascal Olivier Count de Negroni in Senegal in the 1860s or evolving from the Milano-Torino cocktail in Milan. [13] Regardless of the exact origin, the Negroni has been a beloved Italian apéritif for over 100 years.

## Alternative Negroni Recipes

The classic Negroni is so perfectly balanced that it has inspired countless riffs and variations by swapping out one or more of the core ingredients. Here are some popular alternatives to try:

- Negroni Sbagliato: Substitute the gin for prosecco, creating a lighter, fizzier drink. [7][11]
- Boulevardier: Use bourbon or rye whiskey instead of gin. [10][16]
- Mezcal Negroni: Swap the gin for smoky mezcal. [10][18]
- Cynar Negroni: Replace Campari with the artichoke-based amaro Cynar. [14][17]
- White Negroni: Use Lillet Blanc instead of sweet vermouth and a lighter bitter aperitif like Suze. [14][17]
- Sloe Gin Negroni: Split the gin base with sloe gin for a berry twist. [15]

The versatility of the Negroni formula - equal parts spirit, bitter aperitif, and sweet vermouth - has allowed bartenders to create countless delicious spins while retaining the core bitter and herbal flavors of the original. [10][16][17]
