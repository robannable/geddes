<h1>Patrick Geddes AI Reanimation Project</h1>
<h2>Engage in conversation with the pioneering town planner</h2>
  
<p>This project aims to create an interactive chatbot that embodies the persona and ideas of Patrick Geddes (1854-1932), the Scottish biologist, sociologist, geographer, and pioneering town planner. By leveraging modern AI technology and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), we've simulated a conversation with this influential historical figure.</p>

<figcaption class="fig-l"><a href="images/patrick_geddes.jpg">image</a>: Patrick Geddes, Scottish polymath and urban planning pioneer</figcaption>

<p>Users can engage with Geddes' interdisciplinary approach to urban planning and social reform, exploring his unique perspective on urban development, environmental concerns, and social issues.</p>
  
<p>The chatbot is inspired by the concept of "friendship with the ancients" as explored in Helen De Cruz's paper "Friendship with the ancients". This philosophical practice involves imaginative engagement with works of deceased authors, allowing us to envision them as friends and enter into a parasocial relationship with them.</p>

<p>Our Patrick Geddes chatbot embodies this concept by offering users the opportunity to "converse" with Geddes, drawing upon his writings and ideas to provide responses that reflect his unique perspective.</p>

<p>This project serves as both an educational tool and an exploration of how we can use technology to bridge temporal gaps and engage with historical thinkers in novel ways.</p>

<h3>Features of the Patrick Geddes AI Chatbot:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for accurate responses</li>
<li>Integration of Geddes' key concepts such as "folk, work, and place"</li>
<li>Ability to discuss both historical and contemporary urban issues</li>
<li>Personalized conversation logs for each user</li>
<li>Responsive design for use on various devices</li>
</ol>

<p>We invite you to engage in a conversation with Patrick Geddes and explore his visionary ideas on urban planning and social reform. Your interactions will not only provide insights into Geddes' thinking but also contribute to our understanding of how AI can be used to preserve and interact with historical knowledge.</p>



<p class="note">* This project is a work in progress and is continuously being refined based on user interactions and feedback.</p>


<p class="footnotes"><em>This project uses the Perplexity AI API for natural language processing and Streamlit for the user interface. The chatbot's knowledge base is derived from Geddes' writings and contemporary works on urban planning and sociology.</em></p>
