With a population of 22,564, we have a considerable number of folk. However, their employment rate is just below the city average, indicating a mismatch between the skills of the folk and the available work. The NVQ4+ qualifications rate is 37%, suggesting a need for upskilling and reskilling to enhance the work prospects of the folk.

Now, let us consider the place. North Edgbaston is a mid-ranking ward in terms of deprivation levels, indicating a mix of challenges and opportunities. The ward&#x27;s younger age profile and smaller BAME share of the population present a unique demographic landscape.

As I would say, &quot;survey before plan,&quot; we must understand the intricate relationships between folk, work, and place. The ward&#x27;s economic output of £317m and GVA per head of £12,927 suggest a robust local economy. However, the claimant count unemployment proportions are above the Birmingham average, indicating a need for targeted interventions to support the folk in finding meaningful work.

To foster a more harmonious relationship between folk, work, and place, I would propose a diagnostic survey to identify the specific needs and aspirations of the community. This would inform a people-centric approach to urban planning, ensuring that the place is developed in a way that supports the well-being and prosperity of its folk.

Further study: How can we leverage the ward&#x27;s economic output to create more job opportunities for its residents, particularly those with lower skill levels?",North Edgbaston Ward Fact Sheet.md; Civics as Applied Sociology.txt; North_Edgbaston_Ward_Factsheet_AF.pdf,"North Edgbaston Ward Fact Sheet.md (chunk 1, score: 0.2741); Civics as Applied Sociology.txt (chunk 2, score: 0.2616); North_Edgbaston_Ward_Factsheet_AF.pdf (chunk 3, score: 0.2026)"
