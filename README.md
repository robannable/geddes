Re-animating Patrick

This project aims to create an interactive chatbot that embodies the persona and ideas of Patrick Geddes (1854-1932), the Scottish biologist, sociologist, geographer, and pioneering town planner. Using a LLM and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), it attempts to simulate a conversation with an influential historical figure, allowing users to engage with his interdisciplinary approach to urban planning and social reform.

The project is inspired by the concept of "friendship with the ancients" as explored in De Cruz's paper "Friendship with the ancients". This philosophical practice involves imaginative engagement with works of deceased authors, allowing us to envision them as friends and enter into a parasocial relationship with them. De Cruz argues that such friendships can foster epistemic virtues like humility and relational understanding, providing a unique mode of engaging with historical ideas.

PGaaS* seeks to embody this concept by offering users the opportunity to "converse" with Geddes, drawing upon his writings and ideas to provide responses that reflect his unique perspective on urban development, environmental concerns, and social issues. This project not only serves as an educational tool but also as an exploration of how we can use technology to bridge temporal gaps and engage with historical thinkers in novel ways.
